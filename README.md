# TypeScript Bootstrap

A TypeScript bootstrap project: to start your project out without hassle. This project aims to give you the best tools you need to start your project on the right foot. When forking this project to start out your own unique idea, take some time to fill out the information here in this README. Remember, just like this README, your README.md file is the first contact to the end user. Most people don't read any more documentation (although I'm sure you'll have lots!) and really they should be able to get started with no more information than from here. Give them everything they need to get started on their own wonderful project.  
The following is simply a template of information to give. It is not final, it is not correct, it is simply a guidline of best practices.

Now remove this part and fill out the rest with your unique project information. Everything below can be removed, but some can be updated with your project specific information of course.

Be sure to take out other referenceds in the `package.json` file to this before your first commit.
*Remember to give credit where it is due.*

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install and run:
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
* das it

```bash
# make sure you can run in the console
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installing

Run in the terminal:

```sh
npm install
node index.js
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, use `npm test`, that will run all the tests. There is also `test:unit test:functional test:integration`.

### Coding Style in Tests

See the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) project.

## Deployment

You can run it right from your console with either:
`npm start`
or
`node index.js`

There are GitHub workflows that run actions in `.github/workflows` that will automate the testing, coverage reports, documentation, versioning and publishing of the package to both GitHub Packages and the NPM Repository.
Testing is completed by GitHub Actions with Jest on all systems (Windows, macOS and Linux) as well as the latest 3 versions of Node (11, 12, 14) and the coverage reports are sent to Codecov if you have the app connected to your GitHub account.
Documents can be found at the GitHub repo project website (generated from the readme) and appending `/docs` onto the URL.
Packages can be found at both the NPM Repo and GitHub repo.
